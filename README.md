|**ADDING A RECIPE** |1A| As a cooking enthusiast, I want to be able to add my own recipes to the website, so I can share them with others and have a centralized place to store them. | Alex loves cooking and wants to add a new recipe for chocolate chip cookies. They log in to the website, navigate to the "Add Recipe" page, fill in the required information about the recipe, and click on the "Submit" button. The recipe is now saved and visible on Alex's profile and the public recipe list.|
|**VIEWING RECIPES** |2A| As a user, I want to be able to browse and view recipes on the website, so I can find new meal ideas and inspiration. | Taylor visits the website and browses through the public recipes. They find a delicious-looking pasta dish and click on it to view the full recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and any additional notes.|
|**EDITING A RECIPE** |3A| As a user who has added a recipe, I want to be able to edit my own recipes, so I can make updates or correct any errors. | Jamie added a recipe for a vegetarian chili, but they realize they forgot to include an important ingredient. They log in, navigate to their recipe, and click on the "Edit" button. They add the missing ingredient and save the changes. The updated recipe now includes the correct ingredient list.|
|**DELETING A RECIPE** |4A| As a user, I want to be able to delete my own recipes, so I can remove any outdated or unwanted recipes from the website. | Chris decides they no longer want their old smoothie recipe on the website. They log in, find the recipe in their profile, and click on the "Delete" button. The recipe is removed from the website and no longer visible to other users.|
|**MARKING A RECIPE PRIVATE** |5A| As a user, I want to be able to mark my recipes as private, so I can control who can view them. | Morgan creates a special family recipe that they want to keep private. While adding the recipe, they select the "Private" option. Now, only Morgan can see the recipe when logged into their account, and it is not visible to other users or non-logged-in visitors.|
|**MARKING A RECIPE PUBLIC** |6A| As a user, I want to be able to mark my recipes as public, so I can share them with everyone. | Jordan has a private recipe for a homemade pizza that they want to share with the community.
